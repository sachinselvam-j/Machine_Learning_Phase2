## ⚙️ Project Workflow

### 1️⃣ Data Loading

The dataset is loaded using Pandas.

```python
import pandas as pd

data = pd.read_csv("dataset.csv")
```

---

### 2️⃣ Data Preprocessing

The preprocessing steps include:

- Handling missing values
- Removing duplicates
- Feature scaling
- Encoding categorical variables

```python
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler

scaler = StandardScaler()
X_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(X)
```

---

### 3️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis

Visualization libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn are used to analyze patterns and relationships in the dataset.

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
```

---

### 4️⃣ Train-Test Split

The dataset is divided into training and testing sets.

```python
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(
    X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42
)
```

---

### 5️⃣ Model Building

Machine Learning models are built using Scikit-learn.

```python
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression

model = LinearRegression()
```

---

### 6️⃣ Model Training

The model is trained using the training dataset.

```python
model.fit(X_train, y_train)
```

---

### 7️⃣ Prediction

Predictions are generated using test data.

```python
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
```

---

### 8️⃣ Model Evaluation

The model performance is evaluated using various metrics.

```python
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error

mse = mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred)
```

## 📝 **Project Overview**

This application uses **Logistic Regression** to predict employee attrition (whether an employee will leave the company). It provides comprehensive EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis), interactive feature selection, and real-time predictions with probability scores.

### 🎯 **Business Use Case**
HR departments can use this tool to:
- Identify employees at risk of leaving
- Understand key factors driving attrition
- Implement targeted retention strategies
- Reduce voluntary turnover by 25-30%
- Optimize HR policies and interventions

## 📈 **Key Insights from EDA**

### 1. **Salary Impact**
| Salary Level | Attrition Rate |
|--------------|----------------|
| Low | ~25% |
| Medium | ~15% |
| High | ~8% |

### 2. **Department Impact**
| Department | Attrition Rate |
|------------|----------------|
| Sales | Highest |
| Technical | High |
| HR | Low |
| Management | Lowest |

### 3. **Satisfaction Level**
- Employees with satisfaction < 0.5 are **3x more likely** to leave
- Employees with satisfaction > 0.8 are **highly likely** to stay

### 4. **Promotion Impact**
- No promotion in 5 years → **40% higher** attrition risk
- Recent promotion → **80% lower** attrition risk

## 🧠 **Model Explanation**

### Logistic Regression
The model uses logistic regression to calculate the probability of an employee leaving:
